keywords: comfort food, dill pickles

ingredients:
- 5 1/2 cups of chicken broth
- 1 3/4 lbs russet potatoes
- 2 cups chopped carrots
- 1 cup chopped dill pickles (you can't really fit a whole dill pickle in the soup can you?)
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1/4 cup water
- 2 cups dill pickle juice
- 1 1/2 teaspoon table salt
- 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- "Optional garnishes: sliced dill pickles, fresh dill, and black pepper"

directions:
- In a large pot, combine broth, potatoes, carrots and butter. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender. Add pickles and continue to boil.
- In a medium bowl, stir together flour, sour cream and water, making a paste. 
- Vigorously whisk sour cream mixture (2 Tablespoons at a time) into soup. (This will also break up some of your potatoes which is okay. You might see some initial little balls of flour form, but between the whisking and boiling all will disappear. Don't panic.)
- Add pickle juice, Old Bay, salt , pepper and cayenne. 
- Cook 5 more minutes and remove from heat. Serve immediately.

notes:
- All pickle juice is not created equal. Some is saltier than others. Taste your soup after adding the pickle juice and final seasonings. It's possible you will not need any salt or would prefer more or less.

DILL. PICKLE. SOUP. Or, if you'd rather: a hearty, creamy chicken &amp; potato soup with a delightfully salty pickle note.
