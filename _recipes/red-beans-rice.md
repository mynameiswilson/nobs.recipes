ingredients:
- 1 pound dried pinto beans, sorted well, soaked overnight, drained, and rinsed
- 6 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
- 1/2 medium onion (white, yellow, or red), minced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried epazote or Mexican oregano
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon cumin seed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 to 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 5 1/2 cups water
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
- lime juice
- (accompaniments and garnishes) rice, <a href="/recipes/pickled-red-onions">pickled red onions</a>, lime wedges, sour cream, cotija or asadero cheeses, salsa, tortillas


directions:
- Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. 
- In a Dutch oven or oven-safe large saucepan combine beans, smoked hock or pig’s foot, garlic, onion, herbs, bay leaf, cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, sugar, and 5 cups water. 
- Bring to simmer over medium-high heat, then cover and transfer to oven. 
- Cook until beans are tender, 2 to 3 hours. 
- Uncover pot, return to oven, and cook until liquid has thickened, and beans are very creamy, 1 to 2 hours longer.
- Add cilantro, season with lime juice and salt as needed, and serve with desired accompaniments.

notes:
- Look for dried beans that are smooth and shiny; a cracked or dull-looking surface can indicate age or improper storage, which can lead to uneven cooking. 
- Optionally, a smoked ham hock or fresh pig’s foot (split) may be added, if you prefer.
- For refried beans, simply puree beans and sauté in olive oil or bacon fat with minced garlic and chili powder or paprika.
