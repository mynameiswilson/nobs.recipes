ingredients:
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cups packed dark brown sugar
- 1T ground cinnamon
- 1T ground ginger
- 1/2 tsp ground cloves
- 1/2 tsp salt (not kosher)
- 3/4 tsp baking soda
- 12 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 3/4 cup molasses 
- 2 tbsp milk


directions:
- Process flour, sugar, spices, salt, baking soda until combined
- Scatter butter pieces over the top and process until sandy, like very fine cornmeal
- With machine running, add molasses and milk and process until thoughroughly mixed and dough comes together into a soft mass
- Divide dough in half and roll each half 1/4" thick between sheets of parchment
- Freeze the dough in the parchment for 15 minutes or refrigerate at least 2 hrs (you can also leave it overnight)
- Arrange oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 350ยบ
- Cut out cookies (I like to peel off the parchment and then put the dough back on it so that it is easy to pick up the cut cookies. You can also peel off the parchment and lay the dough on a floured surface but then you would add unnecessary flour to the dough). 
- Bake (i like to line the sheet pan with parchment) until just set in the center and dough barely retains an imprint when you touch it gently-- 8-11 minutes.  if you bake them longer they will be more crisp.
- Cool on sheets 2 minutes then remove from sheets and cool on racks

notes:
- I use blackstrap but most recipes say not to - probably you would want to use a regular,unsulphured molasses like Brer Rabbit or Grandma's
-  You can re-roll the scraps as many times as you need.  You are supposed to roll and freeze every round but i get lazy and don't freeze in between...you will know if the dough is too warm/soft
