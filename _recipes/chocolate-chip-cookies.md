totaltime: 82-104 minutes
calories: 125 calories


ingredients:
- 1 cup (2 sticks) salted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 3/4 cups (12 oz) all-purpose flour *If at all possible, please weigh the flour
- 3/4 tsp. smallish-medium coarse sea salt (not table salt)
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 2 1/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

directions:
- Preheat oven to 360 degrees.
- Cream butter, sugar, and brown sugar until it is nice and fluffy (approx. 3 minutes on medium-high speed in stand mixer). 
- Add both eggs and vanilla and beat for an additional 2 minutes. 
- Add baking soda, baking powder, salt, and flour until cookie batter is fully incorporated. 
- Finally add chocolate chips until well distributed. The cookie batter should be somewhat thick. 
- Allow cookie dough to chill in a refrigerator for at least an hour, or less in the freezer.
- Drop about 2 tablespoons of dough or use a medium cookie scoop and plop the batter onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 
- Bake for 12-14 minutes until the edges are nice and golden brown. 
- Remove from heat and allow the cookies to stay on the cookie sheet for an additional 2 minutes. 
- Pick up the parchment paper with the cookies still on top and transfer to a cool non-porous surface. 
- Allow the cookies to cool on the paper for at least 3 minutes before serving. 

notes:
- Please do not use table salt, the sea salt gives the cookies a nice flavor and hints of texture. If you only have table salt, use 1/2 tsp. When using **sea salt**, you will get small crunchy flecks of salt when you bite into the cookie. If you do not like this taste, go with 1/2 teaspoon of table salt. 
- I realized grocery stores sell bags of **chocolate chips** in 12 oz bags but this recipe really needs every last chip. Otherwise you’ll get cookies with only a few chips in each one and this recipe requires lots of chocolate to bulk the cookie up. You’ll need about 1 1/2 bags.
